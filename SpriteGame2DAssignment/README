## Reflection
**Total Points Claimed**: [Base: 80% + Extensions: 17% = 97%]
**Challenges**: After attempting to add an extension to the project, my obstacles randomly started spawning outside the game borders, and I couldn't revert it back to a previous state before I made the alterations, so they continued to spawn outside the borders every few games. 
**Learning Outcomes**: How to better navigate Unity as a software as a whole, but also better understand the intricacies that go into building each individual component of a 2D game.
